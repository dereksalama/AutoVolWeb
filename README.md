AutoVolWeb
==========

Note: This branch (i.e. wekatraining) contains the production code.

AutoVolWeb contains the server half of AutoVol. While it runs on a generic Apache server, I deployed it on AWS. For instructions installing Apache on AWS, see http://alextheedom.wordpress.com/cloud/amazon-free-usage-tier-installing-tomcat-7-on-an-ec2-linux-instance/. On the "free usage tier", memory constraints can cause AWS to kill the Apache instance. In this case, you will need to upgrade to a larger machine.
